# playwright-scenarios-kotlin-template

A Kotlin repo that demonstrates the use of the [`playwright-scenarios`](https://github.com/mattbobambrose/playwright-scenarios) Claude Code plugin.

## What's included

- **Playwright for Java** + **Kotest** test dependencies in `build.gradle.kts`.
- Two Gradle tasks the plugin invokes:
    - `installPlaywrightBrowsers` — one-time browser binary download.
    - `recordScenario` — launches Playwright codegen, used by `/record-scenario`.
- The partition layout under `src/test/kotlin/com/bookshelf/scenarios/`, each holding a no-op `*Test.kt` smoke placeholder so `./gradlew test` passes on a fresh clone:
    - `crawl/` — output of `/crawl-site`
    - `record/` — output of `/record-scenario`
    - `convert/` — output of `/doc-to-scenarios`
- One example reviewed scenario per partition under `src/test/scenarios/` so you can see the format before authoring your own:
    - `crawl/nav-to-cart.md` — single-click navigation discovered by `/crawl-site`
    - `record/add-to-cart-and-checkout.md` — recorded checkout flow
    - `convert/login-and-logout-roundtrip.md` — multi-test scenario converted from a doc by `/doc-to-scenarios`
- JUnit 5 platform wired up so Kotest StringSpec runs.

## Getting started

1. **Use this template.** Click the green **Use this template → Create a new repository** button at the top of the GitHub page to spin up your own copy. Then clone the new repo locally. (Plain `git clone` of *this* repo also works if you don't want a fresh repo of your own.)
2. **Follow the [tutorial](https://mattbobambrose.github.io/playwright-scenarios/tutorial/)** — a walkthrough that exercises crawl, record, and doc-driven authoring, ending with an executable test suite.

## Requirements

- JDK 17 or later (the toolchain is set in `build.gradle.kts`).
- `playwright-cli` for the live-site exploration commands (`/crawl-site`, `/review-scenario`, `/scenario-to-tests`)

```

Scenario markdown lives at `src/test/scenarios/{crawl,record,convert}/` — the partition subdirs are created by `loading-config` on first run. The placeholder `*Test.kt` files in each test partition are smoke tests so `./gradlew test` passes immediately; you can leave them alongside generated tests or delete them once you have your own.

`src/test/docs/` is a suggested home for the input documents you feed to `/doc-to-scenarios`. The plugin doesn't enforce this location — pass any path you like — but having a stable directory keeps your repo tidy.
